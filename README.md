### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

* used `border-box` to fix sizing/layout issues 
* made images responsive using the `background-image` property
* used hsl instead of hex for colors
* used CSS Variables to speed up design

```css
:root {
  --cream: hsl(30, 38%, 92%);
}

body {
  background-color: var(--cream);
}
```
